<h1>Git Commands</h1>
<h4>What is Git?</h4>
<pre> 
	Git is a widely used modern version control system for tracking changes in computer files.
	Git is a version control system.
	Git helps you keep track of code changes.
	Git is used to collaborate on code.
	Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005,
	and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.
</pre> 
<h4>What does Git do?</h4>
<pre>
	Manage projects with Repositories
	Clone a project to work on a local copy
	Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
	Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
	Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
	Push local updates to the main project
</pre>
<h4>Why git ?</h4>
<pre>
	Over 70% of developers use Git!
	Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
	Developers can see the full history of the project.
	Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.
</pre>
<h4>Different between git & github</h4>
<pre>
	Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes.
	Git is a version control system to track changes in source code
	Git is a tool that's used to manage multiple versions of source code edits that are 
	then transferred to files in a Git repository
	Git is a tool that a developer installs locally on their computer
</pre>
<pre>	
	GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service that offers
	all of the distributed revision control 
	and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features
	It is a collaboration and version control platform for storing and managing code
	GitHub is a centralized source code hosting service
	GitHub is an online service that stores code pushed to it from computers running the Git tool
</pre>
<h4>What are some alternatives to GitHub</h4>
<pre>
	GitLab
	Bitbucket
	Gitea
	SourceForge
	Launchpad
	Google Cloud Source Repositories
	AWS CodeCommit
	GitBucket
	Assembla
	Jira
</pre>
<h4>What are the main differences between GitLab and GitHub</h4>
<pre>
	GitLab offers a free community edition,
	GitHub offers a free plan for public repositories, but charges for private repositories
</pre>
<h4>Repository</h4>
<pre>
	A repository (repo) is collection of files and directories that are managed by git.
	repository contains all the information about the project, 
	including history of changes
	who made the changes,and when the changes were made.
	repository is like digital folder that contains all files,folder,code and documentation for a project
	1 local repository 
	2 remote repository
</pre>
<h4>Differences between Local and remote repository</h4>
<pre>
	Local repository is copy of the repository that exists on your computer.
	Remote repository is copy of the repository that exists on a separate serve or hosting service
	such as github,gitlab or bitucket.
</pre>
<h4>What is git directory</h4>
<pre>
	Git directory is a hidden directory that git users to store all the mete data and object database for git repository
</pre>
<h4>Untracked file</h4>
<pre>
	Untracked file is file in your git repository that git is not currently aware of tracking
	Git is not monitoring the file for changes and the file is not included in git history or commits

	-f stands for "force" and is required to actually delete the files.
	-d allows Git to remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files.
	If you want to see what will be removed before actually deleting the files,
	you can use the -n (dry run) option:

	To remove untracked files and directories
	-> git clean -fd
</pre>
<h4>Tracked file</h4>
<pre>
	Tracked file is git is aware of and is being tracked by git.
</pre>
<h4>Unstaged</h4>
<pre>
	Unstaged refers to changes that you have made to your files in git repository that 
	have not yet been added to the staging area using the git add command.
	Changes you are made have not yet been included in the next commit.
</pre>
<h4>Staged</h4>
<pre>
	The staged area is where you prepare changes to be included in the next commit.
	After making changes to files in your working directory, you can stage them using the git add command.
 	This marks the changes to be included in the next commit.
</pre>
<h4>Snapshot</h4>
<pre>
	Each commit in a git repository is unique snapshot that represents a specific version of the project.
</pre>

<h4>Git cherry pick </h4>
<pre> 
	Cherry-picking in Git stands for applying some commit from one branch into another branch.
	In case you made a mistake and committed a change into the wrong branch, 
	but do not want to merge the whole branch. You can revert the commit and apply it on another branch.
	Cherry-pick is a useful tool, but always it is not a good option.
	We want to merge a whole branch into another branch. You only need to pick one or two specific commits. 
	To pick some changes into your main project branch from other branches is called cherry-picking.

	-> git cherry-pick commit id  
	-> git cherry-pick 776a7cb605b5f1281f963ea39f70a194f15a92b1	
</pre>
<h4>How to check new branch is created from which branch</h4>
<pre>
	-> git show-branch --current
</pre>
<h4>Git merge and git rebase</h4>
<pre>
	git merge is that git merge is a way of combining changes from one branch into another, 
	preserving the history of the source branch<br>
	git rebase is a way of moving the changes from one branch onto another, 
	typically the master branch,
	and flattening the history by removing unwanted entries.<br>
	When using git merge, a new merge commit is created<br>
	git rebase creates a new set of commits applied on top of the target branch, 
	resulting in a linear history.<br>
	git merge is used to join two or more development histories together, 
	preserving the original history<br>
	git rebase is used to integrate the changes from one branch into another,
	creating a linear history 
	and applying changes in a more orderly manner<br>
	Functionality: git merge creates a new commit that combines the changes from one branch (the source branch)
	into another (the destination branch).
	Commit History: This creates a new merge commit, preserving the commit history of both branches.
	It shows the point where the two branches diverged and where they were merged.
	Clarity in History: It maintains a clear linear history but may introduce frequent merge commits, 
	resulting in a more cluttered history, especially in complex projects with many branches.<br>
	Functionality: git rebase moves or rewrites the commit history of a branch by applying the commits 
	from one branch onto another branch.
	Commit History: It reapplies the commits from the source branch onto the tip of the destination branch, 
	creating a new linear history without extra merge commits.
	Clarity in History: It produces a cleaner and more linear history, 
	as if the changes on the rebased branch were originally made on top of the destination branch. However, 
	it rewrites commit history, which could potentially cause conflicts or.
	difficulties for collaborators who also have the old commits.
